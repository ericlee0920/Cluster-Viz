# Expression Cluster Visualization
## Updated: November 07, 2020.
This pipeline performs clustering on high dimensional expression single-cell data in a non-spatial context as well as the visualization of the clusters in network graphs and hierarchical clustering heatmaps. 

### Background and Rationale
•	include the what’s and why’s – also your aims
•	include any package dependencies that are required (bullet points are ok for this)
•	You can include your DAG here


### Usage
•	Installation (if necessary) including any datasets that are to be used if they are not provided (i.e. how to download them using wget or curl – exact paths need to be specified and the data must be accessible)
•	Exact step by step usage with descriptive comments on what action is being performed in each step

```
pip install PhenoGraph
```

### Input
Describe the format of the input data, explaining all fields.


### Output
Describe the format of the output including files and visualizations. Treat this section like the results of a paper. You can look at readthedocs pages of popular bioinformatics tools to get inspired for this.
